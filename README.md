Created to show ability of creating interactive webpage using JavaScript. This project was made for educational purposes only.

This website is made up of only one web page with three separate sections: Home, Quiz Section and Result Box.

The business goals for this website are:

1. To promote Premier League and knowledge about the best league in the world
2. To inspire users to play the quiz
3. To reach as many people as possible with the quiz

The user goals of this website are:
1. As a first-time visitor, I want to easily find buttons to play the game and interact with the game
2. As a recurring or first-time visitor, I want to find information of how exactly to play the game
3. As a recurring or first-time visitor, I want to have fun with questions and see my result of the quiz


## UX

### **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles, I first started to think about the strategy for this website and defined who the target users would be and what features/technologies they would want.

Premier League Quiz target users are:
* Aged 01-99
* Football lovers, fans, anyone who follows football in general as Premier League is the most watched leauge in the world
* Have an interest to test their knowledge

What these users would be looking for:
* Clear information and easy-to-use interaction
* Good & simple looking design that provides inspiration and make the quiz look desirable

This quiz has been built to offer all of these things. An effort was taken to provide as intuitive interaction as possible for every user visiting the webpage.

Due to the age group of the users, it is assumed that most users will be viewing the site not only on their mobile phones, but also on the tablets or computers. Therefore, creating something responsive is integral to the design.

### **Scope**

In order to achieve the desired user & business goals, the following features will be included in this release:

- Simple Home section with button to Start Quiz
- Popup window explaining how to play the Quiz and options of either Exit or Play
- Quiz Section which contains 10 Questions with 4 possible answers
- Every question has only one correct answer
- Only after answering each question, player can move to another one
- After the last question the result will be shown in Result Box section
- Player can go back to menu of the game if needs or play again upon clicking on button Try Again 

### **Structure** 

This is one page website to reach simplicity.

I chose the following order for the gameplay 'Home > Pop up window with rules > Quiz Section > Result Box', as I felt this would allow the whole flow of quiz to be digested in the best way.

I also chose to use maximum of 10 questions and double-checked them on Wikipedia where are tracked all of English Premier League records. 

### **Skeleton**

As this project is mostly about Interaction for user, I decided to focus on gameplay and quality of JavaScript code. Therefore, I used as little text and images as possible. 

I intentionally used CSS styling to make interaction with this quiz funny and handy, with examples of text styling, hovering effect on buttons or showing the right answer after clicking the wrong one.

Last but not least, I added responsiveness to allow user play the quiz on a different devices. 

I felt that all mentioned above helps to provide the best user experience and highlight purpose of this project.

### **Surface**

I chose a colour palette based around white & black as these colours are elegant and simple to implement into design with more images on the webapge. I paired these with a lighter red colour to show appropriate contrast.
